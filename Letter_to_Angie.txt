Dear Angie,

Thank you for getting to us and we would be delighted to help you with your problem. As of right now our program has all the specifications asked of you, this is a fully functioning program that runs in python with flask integration to provide a functional and appealing web interface.
Our programs’ capabilities are of the following:
The world will be created and populated with ‘pits’ a ‘paradise’ and a ‘Wumpus’ from a “.txt” file provided by you to allow an easy setup between different levels.
Our agent will explore the world limited to a 4x4 grid and as of right now is limited to the requested ten moves. Its logic is adhering to the rules provided (i.e., Stench means Wumpus is adjacent, breeze means pit is adjacent). The probability calculations are implemented as requested and shows the probability of danger that is distributed between all adjacent “unknown” Chambers.
Our web interface allows your friend to click any chamber to query its status. The system will reply with the following:
	“Safe”(a confirmed safe area, with no pits nor Wumpus)
	“Unknown”(an unvisited, or not proven safe area)
	“Dangerous”(Known dangerous tile containing either a pit or Wumpus)
	“Percept Information”(tile containing breeze or stench)
	“Probability of Pit/Wumpus”(the probability of an unknown tile or dangerous tile)
The complete code, along with the ‘ReadMe.txt’ and the initial “KB.txt”, will be provided in our canvas link, and the day of the in-class demonstration on October 21st. We appreciate the opportunity and look forward to revealing our hard work to you.

Sincerely,
Ryan, Danny, and Jeff
